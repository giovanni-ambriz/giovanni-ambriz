👋 Hi, I'm Giovanni

I’m an aspiring full-stack web developer with a passion for building user-friendly, problem-solving applications. I enjoy working with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and SQLite, and I’m constantly exploring new technologies to expand my skill set. I believe in the power of creativity, whether it’s through coding, art, or learning something new.

🌟 About Me
---

I recently completed an intensive web development bootcamp, where I focused on full-stack development and agile methodologies. I’m excited about solving problems through code, collaborating with teams, and continuously improving my abilities as a developer. Whether it’s building apps that make a difference or working on creative side projects, I’m always eager to learn and contribute.

When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying the ourdoors, hiking, snowboarding, swimming or exploring my creativity through painting, music, or writing poetry. I love the challenge of combining logical thinking with creativity, both in and out of tech.
