I‚Äôm an aspiring full-stack web developer with a passion for building user-friendly, problem-solving applications. I enjoy working with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and SQLite, and I‚Äôm constantly exploring new technologies to expand my skill set. I believe in the power of creativity, whether it‚Äôs through coding, art, or learning something new.

üåü About Me

I recently completed an intensive web development bootcamp, where I focused on full-stack development and agile methodologies. I‚Äôm excited about solving problems through code, collaborating with teams, and continuously improving my abilities as a developer. Whether it‚Äôs building apps that make a difference or working on creative side projects, I‚Äôm always eager to learn and contribute.

When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying the ourdoors, hiking, snowboarding, swimming or exploring my creativity through painting, music, or writing poetry. I love the challenge of combining logical thinking with creativity, both in and out of tech.

Chatter -
A team collaboration app designed to work as social media network for DevAcademy graduates. My collaboration in this final group project was building features for creating and deleting posts. Using React and TypeScript on the frontend, I implemented dynamic forms and responsive UI components. On the backend, I worked with Knex.js and SQLite to design relational database schemas for posts, comments, likes and users.

It includes functionality to add, view, and manage sessions for multiple activities. Developed using React, Tanstack Query, Knex.js, and TypeScript, SQLite, Knex. This app highlights my ability to handle user data and implement CRUD operations in a full stack app.

Fav Songs List -
A simple fullstack application for creating and managing a personalized list of favorite songs. Created as part of my first full stack project and help understanding of CRUD operations. Users can add new songs with details like name, artist, album, and a "listened" status, as well as edit or delete existing entries. Built with React and TypeScript on the frontend, and Node.js, Knex.js, and SQLite on the backend. I developed RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations. 

Good Vibes -
A group project designed to spread positivity by displaying motivational phrases and images. My contributions included integrating the external API to fetch motivational content, creating reusable React components for dynamic rendering, and helped with styling using CSS. I also collaborated closely with teammates to design a responsive and visually appealing interface, testing functionality, and refining the user experience. This project highlights my teamwork and technical skills in building engaging, API-driven applications.
